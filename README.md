#Dots
######July 2015

Dots is another one of my small projects I worked on lightly for about a week. I had the idea for a phone game, but I didn't want to deal with the trouble of actually making a phone game so I just made it on the computer to see what it'd be like.

As I made it more the idea seemed to be less practical and almost impossible to play so I stopped working on it; but it was still helpful as more practice in design.
